# CTF Solutions Repository

Welcome to my Capture The Flag (CTF) solutions repository! This repository contains write-ups and solutions for various CTF challenges from different platforms. I aim to document my approach and thought process behind solving these challenges.

## About

This repository serves as a collection of solutions I've devised for CTF challenges across multiple platforms, including:

- [CyberTalents](https://cybertalents.com)

Feel free to explore the challenges and solutions. I've provided write-ups where I discuss the steps I took to solve each challenge, including the tools used, methodologies, and any insights gained during the process.

## Folder Structure

- `/Platform_Name_1`: Solutions and write-ups for challenges from Platform Name 1.

Each platform's folder contains subdirectories challenges, along with detailed explanations for each challenge solved.

## How to Navigate

- Browse through the respective platform folders to access the challenges and their solutions.
- Each challenge directory contains:
    - `README.md`: Detailed explanation of the challenge and my approach.
    - `solution.txt`: Code or write-ups for solving the challenge.
    - Additional files as needed (e.g., attachments, scripts).

## Contributions

For the time being I'll continue adding to this repo as a personal reference & as a resource if someone needs any help.
